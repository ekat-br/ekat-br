Coding - Love at Second Sight

I discovered coding during my studies in business informatics. To be honest, I did find it somewhat enjoyable during university, but we didn't become close friends. It wasn't until after I graduated and started my first job in IT consulting that I gave coding a second chance. My interest in coding had been sparked leading me to enroll in a coding bootcamp to intensively learn web-development. I can confidently say that I found my passion. Innovative technologies, efficient processes and agile transformation truly captivate me. My goal is to design and drive high-quality software products as a web developer, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
